Credit Card Default Prediction using IBM Watson Studio
Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will default on their credit card payment using machine learning models built and deployed on IBM Watson Studio. The goal is to help financial institutions assess credit risk effectively.

Dataset
The dataset contains details of customer transactions, credit limits, past payment history, and demographics.
Target Variable: Default Payment (Yes/No)
Features Include:
Credit limit
Payment history
Bill amount
Demographic details (age, education, etc.)
Technologies Used
IBM Watson Studio: Model training and deployment
IBM AI Runtime Services: Running the ML pipelines
IBM AutoAI: Automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning
Libraries Used:
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
Model Selection
Multiple machine learning models were evaluated using IBM AutoAI, with the best models ranked based on accuracy.

Rank	Model Pipeline	Algorithm	Accuracy
1	Pipeline 6	Snap Random Forest	0.821
2	Pipeline 2	XGB Classifier	0.820
3	Pipeline 4	XGB Classifier	0.820
4	Pipeline 3	XGB Classifier HPO	0.820
5	Pipeline 8	Snap Random Forest	0.819
6	Pipeline 7	Snap Random Forest	0.819
7	Pipeline 1	XGB Classifier HPO	0.818
Results
The Snap Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 82.1%.
The K-S Chart was used to determine the best threshold for credit risk assessment.
Hyperparameter tuning (HPO) improved the performance of XGBoost models.
